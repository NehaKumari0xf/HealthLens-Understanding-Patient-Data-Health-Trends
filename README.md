## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning â€“ Contributor: [Neha Kumari]

My role in the HealthLens project focused on cleaning and preparing the patient dataset for analysis and modeling.

### Tasks Performed:

- rename column name
- Removed duplicate and null entries
- Handled outliers in features like age, cholesterol, and resting blood pressure
- Standardized column names and formats
- Converted categorical variables into numerical form (where needed)
- Ensured data consistency for modeling and visualization

## ðŸ“ˆ EDA Analysis â€“ Contributor: [Niladribhushan Chaturvedi]

My role in the HealthLens project focused on generating insightful and interactive graphs of patient dataset for analysis and modeling.

### Tasks Performed:
- import and added cleaned dataset
- generated countplot for distribution of heart disease amoung patients
- generated heart disease occurance ratio pie chart between males and females
- Visualized the heart disease growth due to various factors using kdeplot
- Visualized the range of the factors in which heart disease is occuring using boxplot
- Visualized the probability distribution of factors affecting the heart disease occurance in patients
